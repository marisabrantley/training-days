# Training Days Project

For this JavaScript project, we were to help the Training Days service fix their program that sends messages to users for events they've signed up for, as well as notify them of the days they have left to train.
The program was using the wrong scope for its variables, which we fixed to make the program more maintainable and less error-prone.
